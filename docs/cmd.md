import "github.com/aaronlmathis/dynago/cmd/dynago"
```

Command dynago is the entry point for the dynago dynamic DNS updater application.

This command\-line tool loads configuration, initializes logging, and starts the DNS update service. It supports updating DNS records for multiple providers \(Cloudflare, Route53, etc.\) based on the current public IP address of the host. The service runs until interrupted \(SIGINT/SIGTERM\).
